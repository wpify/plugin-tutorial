# Example WPify Plugin tutorial

This is an example plugin to demonstrate how we at WPify create plugins.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enjoy!

## The goal of the plugin

The aim is to create simple plugin that stores information about books and their authors. On this, we demonstrate
the advanced techniques of creating a plugin.

## Steps:

### 01 - Basic concepts - OOP, Namespaces, Composer, Dependency Injection

Let's start with building the basic plugin structure using OOP, Namespaces, Composer and Dependency Injection.

```bash
composer require php-di/php-di
```

### 02 - WPify Scoper

In this step, we are adding the WPify Scoper to the plugin, so that the dependencies are not conflicting with other
plugins.

```bash
composer require wpify/scoper
```

### 03 - WPify Custom Fields

In this step, we are adding the WPify Custom Fields to the plugin, so that we can easily create custom fields for our
plugin. Custom fields are required in composer-deps.json file.
